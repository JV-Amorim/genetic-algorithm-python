# Genetic Algorithm

Run `python src/main.py` or `py src/main.py` to execute the algorithm.

Read the following document for more details: 
[Computação Natural - Primeiro Trabalho Prático](./docs/computacao-natural-trabalho-pratico-1.pdf).

Set the `config.py` file with the following values to have the best possible results. With the number of executions equal to 1000, the program will be a little slow (about 1 minute per run), so please wait.

```python

NUMBER_OF_EXECUTIONS_PER_RUN = 1000

# ...

NATURAL_SELECTION_METHOD = NaturalSelectionMethods.TOURNAMENT
MUTATION_RATE = 0.4

```
